Credit risk modelling using logistic regression

## Introduction
Data is everywhere and so are data professionals. One of the industries that deals with large volumes of data is the finance industry. Amongst many of its characteristics, there is a key trait that separates it from other industries, and that is its heavy regulation. When it comes to data science, fairness-focused regulations mean there is a strong need for explainability, particularly when it comes to models. This is why logistic regression is so commonly used to model the credit risk of individuals and small and medium enterprises. This is an end-to-end project where we build a credit risk model.
